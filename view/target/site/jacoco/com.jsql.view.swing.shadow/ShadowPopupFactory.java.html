/**
 * The JGoodies Looks implementation of {@code PopupFactory}.
 * Adds a drop shadow border to all popups except ComboBox popups.
 * It is installed by the JGoodies Plastic L&amp;amp;F, as well as by
 * the JGoodies Windows L&amp;amp;F during the Look&amp;amp;Feel initialization,
 * see {@link com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.PlasticLookAndFeel#initialize} and
 * {@link com.jgoodies.looks.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel#initialize}.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * This factory shall not be used on platforms that provide native drop shadows,
 * such as the Mac OS X. Therefore the invocation of the {@link #install()}
 * method will have no effect on such platforms.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; To be used in a sandbox environment, this PopupFactory
 * requires two AWT permissions: {@code createRobot} and
 * {@code readDisplayPixels}. The reason for it is, that in the case of
 * the heavy weight popups this PopupFactory uses a Robot to snapshot
 * the screen background to simulate the drop shadow effect.
